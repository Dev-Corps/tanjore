              Rakesh Kumar came to Canada from MP, India in 1989 with a passion
              for food and culinary arts. He was offered a head chef position at a
              popular local Indian restaurant in Scarborough where he worked for
              over 10 years.

              In 2004, Rakesh finally decided he wanted to put his culinary skills
              to the test and he and his wife Neeru opened their very own little
              takeout restaurant called Tanjore Catering & Sweets. This quickly
              became a local favourite!

              Wanting to provide an authentic dine in experience, in 2017 they
              decided to take the leap and expand their restaurant to a larger
              location, providing a buffet style lunch 6 days a week. Customers
              were coming from different cities to try out our savoury dishes.
              Some of our popular must tries are the Palace Naan, the Biriyanis
              and of course our mouth-watering butter chicken!

              Today, Tanjore is an admired family restaurant in Belleville, ON and
              even though we had to leave our dedicated customers in Scarborough,
              it definitely hasnâ€™t stopped them from travelling here!
